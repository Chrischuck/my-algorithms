//  A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence
//  by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
//  Longest common subsequence (LCS) of 2 sequences is a subsequence, with maximal length,
//  which is common to both the sequences. 
//  Given two sequence of integers, 
//  A = [a1, a2, a3,..., aN] and B = [b1, b2, b3,...,bN],
//  find any one longest common subsequence.
